# Medical-Cost-EDA-And-Regression-Models

Tech stacks used : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit learn

Agenda: to investigate a range of health-related factors and their interconnections to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance accurately

performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized data and created regression models like linear regression model, gradient boost regressor, decision tree regressor and random forest regressor to predict healthcare costs and correlation between costs and various reasons/factors

This project protraits the potential of machine learning techniques in predicting healthcare costs and correlation between different factors like age, gender, smokers or non smokers, region, and more
